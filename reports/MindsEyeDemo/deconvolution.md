First we define a forward filter, in this case a simple convolution filter emulating motion blur

Code from [MindsEyeDemo.scala:351](../../src/test/scala/MindsEyeDemo.scala#L351) executed in 0.51 seconds: 
```java
    def singleConvolution: ConvolutionSynapseLayer = {
      val convolution = new ConvolutionSynapseLayer(Array[Int](3, 3), 9)
      (0 until 3).foreach(ii⇒{
        val i = ii + ii * 3
        convolution.filter.set(Array[Int](0, 2, i), 0.333)
        convolution.filter.set(Array[Int](1, 1, i), 0.333)
        convolution.filter.set(Array[Int](2, 0, i), 0.333)
      })
      convolution.freeze
      convolution
    }
    val net = new PipelineNetwork
    net.add(singleConvolution)
    net.add(singleConvolution)
    net.add(singleConvolution)
    net
```

Returns:

We load an ideal training image, which we will try to reconstruct: 

Code from [MindsEyeDemo.scala:371](../../src/test/scala/MindsEyeDemo.scala#L371) executed in 0.66 seconds: 
```java
    val read = ImageIO.read(getClass.getResourceAsStream("/monkey1.jpg"))
    def scale(img: BufferedImage, scale: Double) = {
      val w = img.getWidth
      val h = img.getHeight
      val after = new BufferedImage((w * scale).toInt, (h * scale).toInt, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB)
      val at = new AffineTransform
      at.scale(scale, scale)
      new AffineTransformOp(at, AffineTransformOp.TYPE_BILINEAR).filter(img, after)
    }
    scale(read, 0.5)
```

Returns: 

![Result](deconvolution.1.png)



Next we run this ideal image through our constructed filter to create a blurred image: 

Code from [MindsEyeDemo.scala:386](../../src/test/scala/MindsEyeDemo.scala#L386) executed in 1.52 seconds: 
```java
    blurFilter.eval(Array(Array(idealImageTensor))).data.head
```

Returns:
